# House-Price-Linear-Regression
Linear regression model done over a house prices competition dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).
The aim of the competition is for people to use more advanced regression techniques such as random forest regression and gradient boosting, however I thought it would be a good dataset to try out a linear regression model.
I have completed the linear regression using a Jupyter notebook and Python 3.
