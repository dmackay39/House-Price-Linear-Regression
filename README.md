# House-Price-Linear-Regression
Linear regression model done over a house prices competition dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).
The aim of the competition is for people to use more advanced regression techniques such as random forest regression and gradient boosting, however I thought it would be a good dataset to try out a linear regression model.

I have now completed linear regression, neural network regression, and random forest regression in this notebook. I compare the results of them and find random forest regression to work the best so far. I also investigate how the number of trees in the random forest affects the R^2 score of the regression.
